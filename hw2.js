// returns the number of KelloggCoin that user has in their KelloggCoin "wallet".

// HINT! You will have to use all the JavaScript programming fundamentals we've
// learned about so far, i.e. variables, arrays, objects, conditionals, loops,
// and functions, to complete this task. There are ways to do this using some
// more advanced array functions, and by all means, experiment with this, but
// get it done using just the basics first.

// It should print out:
// Brian's KelloggCoin balance is 8000
// Ben's KelloggCoin balance is 10350
// Jeff's KelloggCoin balance is 2650
